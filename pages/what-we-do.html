            With digital acceleration, IT must develop and support modern
            applications to deliver successful business outcomes while
            maintaining legacy applications developed over decades. This
            combination of often poorly documented legacy systems and modern
            applications deployed across different types of infrastructure makes
            it highly challenging. Over time, application request backlogs pile
            up, and technology debt increases. Organizations are looking to
            modernize with minimal business disruption to catch up with business
            needs.
